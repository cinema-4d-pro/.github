# Cinema 4D
CINEMA 4D is a complete and complex solution for 3D video animation that gives you total power and control throughout the whole design and creation process..

CINEMA 4D provides all you need to create high-end 3D pictures and animations. It consists of different modules according to your design needs. There are 8 different ones in total although each has to be purchased separately in addition to the main package.

 It should be noted from the start that CINEMA 4D is a highly technical and professional package that isn't suitable for those new to 3D animation or modeling. It's designed for professionals in film making, TV, advertising, science, architecture and other fields that require professional results.

The speed that CINEMA 4D can manipulate and render animations is one of its strongest points. Certainly those used to working with Maya may notice significant speed improvements although this is obviously also dependent on your working on a 64-bit Mac. The customization modules are also one of the strongest aspects of CINEMA 4D allowing you to customize the package according to whether you are animating for film, architecture, 3D modeling etc.

For all those that aren't impressed with Maya and need a professional 3D animation suite, CINEMA 4D is the complete package..

## Changes
Improved stability while cacheing MoDynamics A specific combination of certain cloner modes did not work with Spline Mask - fixed MoGraph Data node was not able to read or write correct data from clones under certain conditions - fixed Fixed incorrect behavior of Tracer with Thinking Particles Enhanced compatibility of Collada .dae files Fixed animation export in VRML2 files Evaluate() function in C.O.F.F.E.E. now back with pre 11.5 behavior Improved stability when using FindUniqueID in C++ SDK Improved support for WACOM pen tablet Fixed incorrect behaviors of rotational morph Fixed a problem in the sun expression QuickTime problem on Mac (especially with NET Render) solved Virtual Walkthrough in Architecture Edition is back

## Pros
- Customisable modules depending on the type of animation you do
- Very fast and powerful
- Suitable for professionals
- Optiomised for 64-bit machines
## Can I transfer projects from older versions?
Yeah, but you might hit a few compatibility snags if you’re going way back. It’s usually not too bad, though.

## Is Cinema 4D good for beginners?
Definitely. The learning curve’s there, but it’s not brutal. Plus, there are tons of tutorials out there.
